# üéß Real-Time Active Noise Cancellation using RNNoise on Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)** system using the **RNNoise** deep learning model. Designed for low-power embedded platforms like the **Raspberry Pi 4B+**, the system captures live audio via a microphone, applies machine learning‚Äìbased noise suppression, and plays back the enhanced signal in real-time with minimal latency.

It showcases the integration of **Recurrent Neural Networks (GRUs)** for efficient and adaptive audio enhancement, making it ideal for applications such as voice communication, smart assistants, telepresence, and hearing support systems.

## üîç Key Features

- **Low-latency Real-Time Noise Cancellation**  
  Utilizes RNNoise with a multithreaded pipeline for seamless live audio processing on Raspberry Pi.

- **Embedded Deployment**  
  Optimized for **Raspberry Pi 4B+**, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying AI-powered ANC in edge devices.

- **Visualization and Analysis**  
  Includes spectrogram generation and signal analysis (RMS, ZCR, Dynamic Range) for pre/post audio comparison.

- **Robust Architecture**  
  Employs Python-based threaded design for concurrent audio capture, processing, and playback, ensuring system stability.
